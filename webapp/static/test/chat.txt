[09/08/22, 20:03:15] Kavana N Murthy: Code,
[09/08/22, 20:03:16] Kavana N Murthy: ?
[09/08/22, 20:04:33] Pranav Cr: Yes yess
[10/08/22, 19:22:08] Kavana N Murthy: So Ada is on 20th no
[10/08/22, 19:22:12] Kavana N Murthy: Is it like presentation
[10/08/22, 19:22:16] Kavana N Murthy: Or just Google classroom?
[10/08/22, 19:22:31] Pranav Cr: Mm not sure I'll ask mam tomorrow and tell
[10/08/22, 19:22:52] Kavana N Murthy: Haan okay
[11/08/22, 14:22:27] Kavana N Murthy: Bfs DFS Ada u did?
[11/08/22, 17:08:38] Pranav Cr: Ay no bro not yet 🥲
[11/08/22, 20:27:49] Kavana N Murthy: U wrote now?
[11/08/22, 20:29:09] Pranav Cr: yess
[11/08/22, 20:29:18] Pranav Cr: ill forward from where i wrote wait
[11/08/22, 20:29:23] Pranav Cr: write dif values pls
[11/08/22, 20:29:25] Kavana N Murthy: Haan okies
[11/08/22, 20:29:29] Kavana N Murthy: U have the code?

[11/08/22, 20:29:41] Kavana N Murthy: Send me no
[11/08/22, 20:29:48] Kavana N Murthy: I'll run and write diff values
[11/08/22, 20:29:51] Pranav Cr: it is in the zip folder
[11/08/22, 20:29:56] Pranav Cr: but i havent tyoed code
[11/08/22, 20:30:19] Kavana N Murthy: Fine fine I'll write it down thank you
[11/08/22, 20:53:19] Kavana N Murthy: First page
[11/08/22, 20:53:23] Kavana N Murthy: Where I should
[11/08/22, 20:53:27] Kavana N Murthy: Initialise v?
[11/08/22, 20:54:21] Pranav Cr: yeahh
[11/08/22, 20:54:22] Pranav Cr: v=1
[11/08/22, 20:55:20] Kavana N Murthy: No like int v
[11/08/22, 20:55:22] Kavana N Murthy: Where should I put

[11/08/22, 21:07:55] Pranav Cr: Ay bro code only is wrong i think
[11/08/22, 21:07:57] Pranav Cr: 🥲🥲
[11/08/22, 21:07:59] Kavana N Murthy: Yeah uh
[11/08/22, 21:08:03] Kavana N Murthy: I wrote from that book
[11/08/22, 21:08:04] Kavana N Murthy: 😵😂
[11/08/22, 21:08:09] Pranav Cr: Yea just write off bro
[11/08/22, 21:08:15] Kavana N Murthy: But values
[11/08/22, 21:08:16] Pranav Cr: Let lab finish tomorrow then we'll see🤣
[11/08/22, 21:08:23] Kavana N Murthy: 😂 okies
[11/08/22, 21:08:27] Pranav Cr: Write approx same range+-0.2
[11/08/22, 21:08:50] Kavana N Murthy: Haan okies
[12/08/22, 19:45:33] Kavana N Murthy: Yes yes it's sent
[12/08/22, 19:45:37] Kavana N Murthy: Some claned
[12/08/22, 19:45:43] Kavana N Murthy: Something it will come
[12/08/22, 19:48:27] Pranav Cr: Ha yeah that only peace
[12/08/22, 21:08:26] Kavana N Murthy: Do u have prims and krushkals proper code?

[31/05/23, 17:11:00] Kavana N Murthy: And 2 ppl should share 1 focus no
[31/05/23, 17:11:22] Kavana N Murthy: So any 2 can share right? So one focus can have so many ppl no if we make a pair and go on?
[31/05/23, 17:11:43] Pranav Cr: Yeah yeahh
[31/05/23, 17:11:53] Kavana N Murthy: Haan okay
[31/05/23, 17:11:56] Kavana N Murthy: So it’s upto us no
[31/05/23, 17:11:59] Kavana N Murthy: Any thing we can take
[31/05/23, 17:12:02] Kavana N Murthy: ?
[31/05/23, 17:13:24] Kavana N Murthy: How to do this
[31/05/23, 17:13:25] Pranav Cr: Yuppp
[31/05/23, 17:13:31] Pranav Cr: 3a?
[31/05/23, 17:13:35] Pranav Cr: Not there ig
[31/05/23, 17:13:39] Kavana N Murthy: No this question
[31/05/23, 17:13:44] Kavana N Murthy: It was there in that worksheet
[31/05/23, 17:14:29] Pranav Cr: See it's like abc are connected and they can have varied interests.. as shown from the graph
[31/05/23, 17:15:17] Kavana N Murthy: Ahhh
[31/05/23, 17:15:18] Kavana N Murthy: Okay
‎[31/05/23, 17:54:07] Kavana N Murthy: ‎<attached: 00003527-PHOTO-2023-05-31-17-54-07.jpg>
[31/05/23, 17:54:14] Kavana N Murthy: Can u solve 3a
[31/05/23, 17:54:20] Kavana N Murthy: Is there in portions?
[31/05/23, 17:54:36] Pranav Cr: No that's what I told
[31/05/23, 17:54:42] Kavana N Murthy: Ah Okies fine
[31/05/23, 18:02:25] Pranav Cr: Previous test portions is stronger/weaker.
But later balance you can do based on strong considered as +.
[31/05/23, 18:02:29] Pranav Cr: It's there it seems
[31/05/23, 18:02:41] Kavana N Murthy: Ahh
[31/05/23, 18:02:51] Kavana N Murthy: Tell me when u get to know how to do this no
[31/05/23, 18:02:56] Pranav Cr: Right
[31/05/23, 18:11:27] Kavana N Murthy: Then give + - based on threshold
[31/05/23, 18:11:27] Kavana N Murthy: And check for balanced or not
[31/05/23, 18:11:27] Kavana N Murthy: If >5 give it +
[31/05/23, 18:11:27] Kavana N Murthy: If <5 give that edge -
[31/05/23, 18:11:32] Kavana N Murthy: Is this right?
[31/05/23, 18:13:21] Pranav Cr: Yeah but 2 matrices?
[31/05/23, 18:13:43] Kavana N Murthy: No first draw graph for the first one and the next one is just the value to compare
[31/05/23, 18:13:48] Kavana N Murthy: That’s what I thought
[31/05/23, 18:13:56] Kavana N Murthy: Like the value between the edges
[31/05/23, 18:14:13] Pranav Cr: Ah okay

[31/05/23, 21:32:37] Pranav Cr: yea even I didn't understand
[01/06/23, 18:33:57] Kavana N Murthy: Boundary thing just normal one
[01/06/23, 18:34:04] Kavana N Murthy: Or worst case Abe all
[01/06/23, 18:34:06] Kavana N Murthy: And *

[01/06/23, 18:45:09] Kavana N Murthy: But u told only this much
[01/06/23, 18:45:18] Kavana N Murthy: Functional testing comes after that no
[01/06/23, 18:45:26] Kavana N Murthy: Ask her once no
[01/06/23, 18:45:26] Pranav Cr: Even mam told just go through it once for safety

[01/06/23, 21:07:03] Kavana N Murthy: Correct for normal boundary?
[01/06/23, 21:07:37] Pranav Cr: 👍
[01/06/23, 21:07:57] Kavana N Murthy: Then what’s this thing given in ma’am ppt

[01/06/23, 21:08:45] Kavana N Murthy: Ah okay
[01/06/23, 21:09:29] Kavana N Murthy: Robust is Same like this but min- and max+ will be added no?

[01/06/23, 21:26:21] Kavana N Murthy: So wait classes =6 so 6 cases
[01/06/23, 21:26:30] Kavana N Murthy: But the values can be anything no
[01/06/23, 21:26:31] Kavana N Murthy: ?
[01/06/23, 21:27:58] Pranav Cr: Weak normal is number of classes
[01/06/23, 21:28:17] Pranav Cr: Weak robust you can find out by introducing single faults
[01/06/23, 21:28:51] Kavana N Murthy: Strong robust multiple faults?
[01/06/23, 21:29:00] Kavana N Murthy: Always it should be invalid or what?
[01/06/23, 21:29:18] Pranav Cr: Yeah
[01/06/23, 21:29:26] Pranav Cr: Weak normal is always valid
[01/06/23, 21:29:36] Pranav Cr: Weak robust has one invalid rest are nominal
‎[01/06/23, 21:30:08] Kavana N Murthy: ‎<attached: 00003596-PHOTO-2023-06-01-21-30-07.jpg>
[01/06/23, 21:30:37] Pranav Cr: yea I am telling no of variables

[01/06/23, 21:31:53] Kavana N Murthy: Ah Okies got it
[01/06/23, 21:32:05] Kavana N Murthy: So any order I’ll do for 6 cases of my choice no
[01/06/23, 21:32:13] Kavana N Murthy: Where one should be invalid
[01/06/23, 21:32:26] Pranav Cr: Yeah
[01/06/23, 21:39:32] Kavana N Murthy: Data flow which ppt has everything?
[01/06/23, 21:39:35] Kavana N Murthy: Which one to do?
[01/06/23, 21:39:58] Pranav Cr: Both

[01/06/23, 22:48:19] Pranav Cr: Here 6 it is getting used but it's also being defined so we don't consider it?
[01/06/23, 22:48:42] Kavana N Murthy: She told we canceled it cause it’s being getting defined again
[01/06/23, 22:48:48] Pranav Cr: Okay
[01/06/23, 22:48:54] Pranav Cr: So redefine means cancel
[01/06/23, 22:48:58] Kavana N Murthy: Yeah
[01/06/23, 22:49:14] Pranav Cr: Then 1,6 also should be canceled
[01/06/23, 22:49:30] Kavana N Murthy: Yeah Correct answer is that only just checked
[01/06/23, 22:49:42] Pranav Cr: So 1,6 is cancelled?
[01/06/23, 22:50:40] Kavana N Murthy: Yes
[01/06/23, 22:50:46] Pranav Cr: Okay
[01/06/23, 22:51:06] Pranav Cr: 6,3 also should go it's not feasible

[02/06/23, 08:45:40] Kavana N Murthy: So weak robust always single fault  assumption
[02/06/23, 08:45:48] Kavana N Murthy: Or it can have full valid inputs too
[02/06/23, 08:45:49] Kavana N Murthy: ??
[02/06/23, 08:55:15] Pranav Cr: Yeah it has one fault and others are valid
